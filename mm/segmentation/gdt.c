/* The simplest memory model for a system is the basic "flat model" in which the operating system and application
 * programs have access to a continuous, unsegmented address space. To the greatest extent possible, this basic flat
 * model hides the segmentation mechanism of the architecture from both the system designer and the application
 * programmer.
 *
 * To implement a basic flat memory model with the IA-32 architecture, at least two segment descriptors must be
 * created, one for referencing a code segment and one for referencing a data segment. Both of these segments, however,
 * are mapped to the entire linear address space: that is, both segment descriptors have the same base address value of
 * 0 and the same segment limit of 4 GBytes. By setting the segment limit to 4 GBytes, the segmentation mechanism is
 * kept from generating exceptions for out of limit memory references, even if no physical memory resides at a
 * particular address. ROM (EPROM) is generally located at the top of the physical address space, because the processor
 * begins execution at FFFF_FFF0H. RAM (DRAM) is placed at the bottom of the address space because the initial base
 * address for the DS data segment after reset initialization is 0. */
