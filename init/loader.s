; GRUB will transfer control to the operating system by jumping to a position in memory. Before the jump,
; GRUB will look for a magic number to ensure that it is actually jumping to an OS and not some random code.
; This magic number is part of the multiboot specification which GRUB adheres to.

; The align 4 directive is used to ensure that the code is aligned on a 4-byte boundary.
; This is a common requirement for x86 and x86-64 architectures, and ensures that the code will work correctly
; on all platforms. By aligning the code to a 4-byte boundary, the code can be accessed more efficiently by the CPU,
; which can improve performance.

  ; We could point esp to a random area in memory since, so far, the only thing in the memory is GRUB, BIOS,
  ; the OS kernel and some memory-mapped I/O. This is not a good idea - we donâ€™t know how much memory is available or
  ; if the area esp would point to is used by something else. A better idea is to reserve a piece of uninitialized
  ; memory in the bss section in the ELF file of the kernel. It is better to use the bss section instead of the data
  ; section to reduce the size of the OS executable. Since GRUB understands ELF, GRUB will allocate any memory
  ; reserved in the bss section when loading the OS.

  ; a stack location that has not been written (without manual pointer fiddling). A (correct) program can not pop an
  ; element from the stack without having pushed an element onto the stack first. Therefore, the memory locations of
  ; the stack will always be written to before they are being read.
